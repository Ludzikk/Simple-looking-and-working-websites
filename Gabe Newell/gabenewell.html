        <h2>
          American businessman, president of the video game company Valve.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Newell was born in Colorado and grew up in Davis, California. He
          attended Harvard University in the early 1980s but dropped out to join
          Microsoft, where he helped create the first versions of the Windows
          operating system.
        </p>
        <p>
          He and another employee, Mike Harrington, left Microsoft in 1996 to
          found Valve, and funded development of their first game, Half-Life
          (1998).
        </p>
        <p>
          Harrington left in 2000, leaving Newell as the sole owner. As of 2021,
          he owned at least one quarter of Valve. Newell led development of
          Valve's digital distribution service Steam, which launched in 2003 and
          controlled most of the market for downloaded PC games by 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is one of the wealthiest people in the United States; in December
          2021, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$ 3.9 billion.
